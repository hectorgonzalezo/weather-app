## Design ##

Praises:

- The use of dynamic background images is a great touch!

- The color palette is very monochromatic, which gives unity to the whole webpage.

- Watchlist is a great feature, and it works really well.

- The use of Icons really make the whole webpage easy to understand and intuitive.

- Mobile version works really well.

Critiques:

- Some of the data may be difficult to read due to an unfortunate combination of the font color with certain background  images.

- Font size may be a bit small for this particular font. Some words are difficult to understand.

- How about highlighting the city currently selected on the watchlist?

- Would you consider implementing city lookup when pressing enter/return? It's kind of a drag to be forced to press the search button every time.

- It feels kind of crowded, especially the forecast  area.

Additional comments:

- Overall it's a great design, the issues I found are minor but could help make it stand out even more.

## Code ##

Praises:

- Having modules separate really helps understand how every piece of code works individually.

- Choice of naming in functions and the use of comments really help follow the inner workings of  individual modules.

Critiques:

- The structure of the code can be hard to follow with that many import/export combinations.

- How about using id in html elements to simplify the readability and make the query more flexible? I'm talking about cases like line 18 on app-click-events.js, if you wanted to change something in the nesting of the element the html file you would need to rewrite such complex selectors.


Questions:

- Is there a reason to make elements that remain static using Javascript? Like page-header.js and so on.


## Overall ##

The app works really well, and the code is well organized. The only issue I would focus on now would be to work on communicating your ideas more clearly, both with the user and potential readers of your code.
