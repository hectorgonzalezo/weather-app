# Weather App

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

This project involves using [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org)'s API to get weather data from a city chosen by the user, and displaying it on the webpage.

It also uses [GIPHY](https://giphy.com)'s API to look for any GIF relevant to the current weather description. Just for fun!
